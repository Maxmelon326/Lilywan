								<h1 >Hi, I am Li Wan<br /></h1>
								<p>A data-driven professional with a strong background in internal audit and consulting, having worked in a leading fintech and served major enterprise clients across finance, real estate, and infrastructure.<br />
									Throughout my career, I worked at the intersection of business, data, and risk controls that were grounded in detailed data analysis and deep process understanding. Whether evaluating risk or recommending improvements, I‚Äôve always approached problems with first-principles thinking‚Äîbreaking down complexity, staying objective, and focusing on how things truly work. This mindset deepened my interest in data and its broader potential to enhance business performance, uncover insights, and guide strategic decisions.<br /> 
									I‚Äôm currently based in Melbourne AU, looking to build meaningful, impact-driven solutions in businesses that value clarity, integrity, and continuous improvement.</p>

										<p> This project simulates how a FinTech company builds a layered credit risk engine to evaluate new and existing users before making lending decisions.
											Two distinct risk models were developed:</br>
											New User Model: 
											Evaluates applicants using only self-declared demographic and financial information (e.g., age, occupation, income), simulating users with no prior credit history.</br>
											Existing User Model:
											Incorporates behavioral and historical credit data (e.g., credit score, limit utilization, past defaults) to provide a more informed risk assessment.</br>
											Using a real-world structured dataset, two models were trained and compared, simulated approval decisions, and an interactive demo was deployed to replicate a simplified credit review system.</br>
											<strong>Key Results</strong></br>
											A credit decision engine was simulated using risk thresholds to categorize applicants into <em>Auto-Approved</em>, <em>Manual Review</em>, or <em>Rejected</em> groups.<br>
											A Streamlit demo app was built to replicate how credit analysts or automated systems assess applicants in real-time.<br>
											<strong>Tools Used</strong><br>
											Python (Pandas, LightGBM, SHAP, imbalanced-learn), Google Colab, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SMOTE.<br>
											<strong>Outcome</strong><br>
											This project demonstrates how FinTech companies approach risk modeling with different data layers, highlights the gap between new and existing user assessments, and showcases how even modest models can inform real-world lending strategies when paired with business logic. The deployed demo provides a hands-on view of how machine learning integrates into credit decisioning systems.

										<p>
											This project leverages Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI to analyze content features and publishing trends of Netflix movies and TV shows. The dataset includes metadata such as genres, languages, countries, durations, ratings, popularity, and release years.
											Using PySpark in Azure Synapse Notebooks, the data was cleaned and unified before being stored in a Dedicated SQL Pool. An automated Data Pipeline was developed to streamline data integration, and the results were visualized through interactive Power BI dashboards for further analysis.
										<br>
										<strong>Key Analyses</strong><br>
											1. Structural analysis of genres, countries, languages, durations, and ratings by platform (TV vs Movie).<br>
											2. Trends in release year to understand Netflix's publishing strategy over time.<br>
											3. Global content strategy via language and regional content distribution.<br>
											4. Seasonal or monthly release patterns to detect holiday-focused content strategies.<br>

										<strong>Tools Used</strong><br>
										Azure Synapse Analytics, PySpark, Azure Data Factory, Power BI (Desktop & Mobile).<br>

										<strong>Outcome</strong><br>
											An end-to-end cloud-based data analytics workflow was established, showcasing the use of Microsoft tools for large-scale data engineering. The final result is a Power BI dashboard that reveals Netflix's content evolution and platform behavior insights.<br>

										<div class="project-detail" data-id="proj3">
										<p>This project simulates an A/B test to evaluate two different strategies for monetizing emoji reactions in a chat app.<br>
										Group A uses a simplified flow, sending all users directly into the payment funnel.<br>
										Group B introduces pre-qualification steps to filter low-intent users before showing payment options.<br>
										Using a simulated dataset, I analyzed user behavior through five funnel steps and performed statistical comparisons between the two groups.<br>
										<strong>Key Results</strong><br>
										1. Group A achieved significantly higher conversion rates at key monetization steps (payment click & success).<br>
										2. Statistical testing (t-tests) confirmed meaningful differences between the groups.<br>
										3. Funnel visualizations and bar plots provided clear insights into user drop-off and conversion performance.<br>
										<strong>Tools Used</strong> <br>
										Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy), Google Colab, A/B testing principles, T-tests.<br>
										<strong>Outcome</strong><br>
										Group A's simplified design led to better performance, highlighting how reducing friction in conversion funnels can improve monetization.
